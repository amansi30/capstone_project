"Predicting Rainfall Tomorrow": Utilizing historical weather data, including minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall, evaporation, sunshine duration, wind speed and direction, humidity, air pressure, cloud cover, and other relevant factors, develop a predictive model to forecast whether it will rain tomorrow. 
I have run 8 algortithms on this model logistic regression, decision tre classifier, decision tree with pre prunning, AdaBoost Classifier, GradientBoosting Classifier, RandomForest Classifier, XgBoost Classifier and Bagging Classifier.
Ihave got almost good results on all the algorithms but the most good results I got in XgBoost with 95% on all the accuracy, precision, recall and F1 curve on both train and test sets.
